# Thesaurize

- This is a fun little module that will take any length string, parse it for words, and replace those words with random synonyms.

## Usage

- `npm i thesaurize`
- `require("thesaurize")("hello world")`


## Notes

- There is an exclusion list of around 100 words, these are common structural words that help maintain general syntatic flow.
